# Guitar DSP

## Overview

Use this skill for guitar-centric DSP work that spans tone, realtime safety, C++/JUCE DSP modeling, neural model capture/training, RTNeural runtime integration, and host validation. It complements:

- Load `juce-plugin` as well for JUCE API usage, AudioProcessor/APVTS structure, CMake/plugin formats, UI, assets, signing, validation, or host lifecycle.
- Load `dsp` as well for low-level filter/effect cookbook implementations.
- Load `dsp-engineer` as well for spectral analysis, measurements, aliasing experiments, FFT workflows, or prototype reasoning.
- Load `spice-circuit-modeling` as well for building, qualifying or freezing a SPICE/ngspice or KiCad circuit reference (model provenance, convergence, statement-order stress, netlist parity, golden-data generation).
- Load `circuit-to-dsp` as well for turning a circuit reference into a realtime model (reduction, state inventory, nonlinear solvers, integrator/rate choice, SPICE-referenced validation gates).

## Workflow

1. Classify the task:
   - Conventional DSP: pedals, tone stacks, EQ, cabinet, delay, reverb, tuner, metronome, looper.
   - Nonlinear DSP: waveshaping, clipping, diode/fuzz circuits, tube-like stages, aliasing, DC, harmonic measurement, oversampling.
   - Tone and cabinet modeling: tone stacks, presence/depth, cabinet IR, speaker dynamics, cabinet compression.
   - C++/JUCE DSP modeling: block class shape, parameter snapshots, smoothing, circuit-to-DSP translation, tests, measurement fixtures.
   - Circuit-reference validation: schematic interpretation, verified SPICE/reference circuits, equivalent stage/control/level measurements, mismatch isolation, and regression tests. Oracle construction belongs to `spice-circuit-modeling`; realtime model construction and gate design to `circuit-to-dsp`.
   - Neural modeling: capture, alignment, training preset selection, export package validation.
   - Runtime integration: RTNeural model loading, inference, sample-rate policy, model metadata, state restore.
   - Product validation: tests, measurement harnesses, plugin validation, DAW smoke, release gates.
   - Performance: high CPU in a host, benchmark and profiling passes, making an accepted model cheaper without changing its sound. Attribute the cost first; the method belongs to `juce-plugin`, model shortcuts to `circuit-to-dsp`.
2. Read only the reference files needed for that task.
3. Keep the audio callback hard-realtime: no file I/O, JSON parsing, model construction, IR loading, allocations, locks, UI calls, logging, or object destruction that could touch data read by the audio thread.
4. Validate tone and behavior with measurable checks before polishing UI: bypass identity, finite output, reset determinism, automation safety, latency, tail reporting, CPU headroom, aliasing, and DAW state restore.

## Reference Map

| Reference | Read when |

## Helper Scripts

| Script | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/model_package_summary.py` | Inspect an RTNeural JSON or package folder for layers, Conv1D receptive field, metadata, validation/aliasing/benchmark sidecars, and warnings. |
| `scripts/receptive_field.py` | Compute causal Conv1D receptive field and lookback samples from RTNeural/Keras-style JSON. |
| `scripts/compare_audio_metrics.py` | Compare two WAV renders for alignment lag, polarity, RMSE, ESR, correlation, peak error, and DC offset. |
| `scripts/alias_probe_report.py` | Estimate harmonic and non-harmonic energy from a coherent sine WAV render of a nonlinear stage. |

## Default Decisions

- Prefer 48 kHz mono WAV capture for neural models unless the project has a measured reason to differ.
- Preserve capture/output level intent; do not normalize each target independently unless it fixes a documented recording mistake.
- Keep time-based effects out of v1 neural amp/pedal captures unless deliberately researching unsupported behavior.
- Treat mono neural amp cores explicitly: fold stereo input to mono by averaging before the mono core, then fan out after amp/tone processing so cabinet and post-FX can remain stereo.
- For stereo neural package playback, use one RTNeural model instance per channel; recurrent and causal Conv1D models carry state and should not share one model object across channels.
- Parse RTNeural JSON and load IRs outside `processBlock()`. Publish immutable model/IR state to the audio thread with atomics or another realtime-safe handoff.
- Do not silently run a model at the wrong sample rate. Warn, require a matching export, or add an explicitly measured resampling/oversampling path.
- Do not confuse export alignment latency, WaveNet receptive field, and plugin processing latency.
- Prefer dynamic RTNeural JSON for compatibility and proof-of-correctness. Consider static/generated models only after benchmark data shows dynamic JSON is the bottleneck.

## Implementation Shape

For a production guitar modeler, a proven baseline chain is:

```text
input trim / input buffer
  -> gate
  -> compressor
  -> drive / fuzz / boost pedals
  -> neural amp model
  -> amp tone stack / post-amp EQ
  -> cabinet IR or cabinet filter path
  -> modulation
  -> delay
  -> reverb
  -> post color / global master
  -> tuner mute / metronome / utility output
```

Adjust the order deliberately and encode the choice in tests. For amp-head captures, keep cabinet IR optional and post-neural; for amp-plus-cab captures, avoid applying a second cabinet unless the user wants that sound.

## Validation Minimum

Before calling guitar DSP work done:

- Run unit tests for every changed DSP block and processor-level routing path.
- Include bypass, finite output, reset determinism, channel routing, and automation stress checks.
- Benchmark Release builds at small buffers and the target sample rates, with digital silence and identical-channel stereo as their own cases.
- For a performance change, null-test against the previous build and re-run every existing gate unchanged.
- Validate exported RTNeural models with Python parity, native RTNeural parity, runtime benchmark, and aliasing report when neural models are involved.
- Run host validation for plugins: AU validation on macOS when building AU, pluginval for AU/VST3 when available, and at least one DAW session save/reopen smoke.
